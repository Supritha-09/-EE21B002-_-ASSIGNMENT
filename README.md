##Featured Projects

###  N-Queens Problem Solver
Solves the classical N-Queens puzzle using an optimized backtracking strategy that includes diagonal conflict tracking.

- **Language**: C++
- **Highlights**:
  - Constant-time safety checks using boolean arrays
  - Supports dynamic board sizes (N â‰¤ 9)
  - Clean CLI interaction and efficient pruning logic

---

### Module Dependency Cycle Detector
Detects cyclic dependencies in module graphs using DFS with state-tracking.

- **Language**: C++
- **Highlights**:
  - Depth-first traversal with unvisited/visiting/visited states
  - Handles thousands of modules and edges efficiently
  - Useful for analyzing package imports and build systems

---

###   GPU-Based Fireworks Simulator
Simulates fireworks using real-time rendering powered by OpenGL ES 3.0 and custom shaders.

- **Language**: C++
- **Features**:
  - Over 5,000 particles rendered at high frame rates
  - Interactive explosion control via mouse clicks
  - Visual enhancements using instancing and additive blending

---

###  WeatherTrack Android App
An Android app that shows weather trends using MVVM architecture, Room database, and background updates via WorkManager.

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Features**:
  - LiveData observers for UI responsiveness
  - Automatic sync every 6 hours
  - Battery-efficient scheduling and error handling
  - Offline data access and weekly trends visualization
